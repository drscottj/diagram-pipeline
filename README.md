# Overview
This helps to streamline a workflow to programmatically generate diagrams with a rapidly iterated, reproducible, and exportable
workflow, all with reasonably polished visuals. This currently uses D2 to make it all happen.

# What is D2
[D2](https://d2lang.com/) is for declarative diagram generation.

The strengths:
* modern diagram language
* excellent automatic layout
* built-in professional styling
* great typography
* designed for presentation output

This is especially good when:
* you want minimal styling work
* visual quality matters
* diagrams go directly to presentations
* large system diagrams

# Getting started
Install `d2` and optionally `svgo` and `librsvg`, using your favorite method.

## Install tools on macOS
Using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/):
```
brew install d2
brew install svgo
brew install librsvg
brew install fswatch
```
